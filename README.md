# Determinant calculator by Sarrus Rule

This is a Sarrus Rule matrix determinant calculator programmed in C++.

You can enter the dimension of the square matrix and the values of its cells.
Once the shade is created and filled, the algorithm will proceed to calculate the determinant, returning its value and the number of mathematical operations performed.

This is a personal project created with the purpose of practicing the C++ programming language.
